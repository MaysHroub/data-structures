# Data Structures Implementations

This repo contains the implementation of all data structures developed as part of the Data Structures (COMP242) course at Birzeit University.

## Data Structures Implemented
- **Linked List**: A linear data structure containing of nodes, where each node points to the next.
- **Doubly Linked List**: A type of linked list where each node contains a data value, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node. This allows traversal in both forward and backward directions.
- **Cursor Array**: An array implementation of the Linked List.
- **Stack**: A LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure.
- **Queue**: A FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure.
- **Binary Search Tree**: A tree structure where each node has at most two children, and the left child is smaller than the parent node, while the right is greater or equal.
- **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree, where the difference in heights of the left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1.
- **Hash Table**: A data structure that stores key-value pairs and provides fast lookup. There are three types of hashing: Spearate Chaining, Open Adressing, and Double Hashing.
- **Heap or Priority Queue**: A specialized tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property.



### Important Note (⌐■_■)
This repo is intended to help you understand and practice data structure concepts. 
Please use it as a reference and learning tool rather than simply copying and pasting the code :)
